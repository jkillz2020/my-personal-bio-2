      <section>
    I have been involved in four (4) projects requiring high attention to detail and use of different document review/E-Discovery software for a prominent, international law firm, at their Nashville office.  I have worked on a few different teams and different managing attorneys.  I feel they would all give me a good recommendation as to my professionalism and quality of work.

    I provided legal advice to six (6) different regulatory Boards/Commissions and ensured that each Board or Commission performed its licensing application review, disciplinary complaint review and rulemaking functions in accordance with their authorizing statutes and administrative rules. In fulfillment of these duties, I oversaw the efficient review and resolution of the Boards’/Commissions’ complaint and case registries. I also reviewed and recommended best responses to legal inquiries from licensees, industry groups and governmental assemblies to each Board/Commission.

      <section>
    My duties included managing personal injury and Workers' Compensation cases.  I maintained ongoing communication with approximately 80 clients, tracked their medical treatment and their return to work statuses. I also regularly negotiated with insurance adjusters to ensure proper classification and handling of covered claims. When negotiations became unproductive, I drafted various legal documents, primarily demands and complaints.
